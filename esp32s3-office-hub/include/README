This directory is intended for project header files.

A header file is a file containing C declarations and macro definitions
to be shared between several project source files. You request the use of a
header file in your project by including it, with the C preprocessing
directive `#include`.

```src/main.c

#include "project.h"

void setup() {
  // some code
}

void loop() {
  // some code
}
```

Including a header file produces the same results as copying the header file
into each source file that uses it. Such copying would be time-consuming
and error-prone. With the include mechanism, a header file need only be
written once; moreover, an `#include` directive can refer to the same
header file in several source files. A header file can itself include
other header files. One header file can even include several versions of
the same header file. The preprocessing directive `#include` causes the
inclusion of another file, identified by its parameter, into the current
source file at the point where the directive appears.

For the ESP32-S3 Office Hub project, header files include:
- usb_host.h - USB OTG host management functions
- (Additional headers can be added here for project expansion)
